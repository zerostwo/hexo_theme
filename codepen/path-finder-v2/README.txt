A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/blazicke/pen/wrOPjx.

 It's the evolution of the first version of the Path Finder game (https://codepen.io/blazicke/full/MEvZRR/).
It's a simple game: all you have to do is to link the selected point to the nearest dot.

In this version I added the time management and the autoplay at the end of each level.
